# Zig Compiler in Rust

I'm porting the Zig compiler to Rust as a learning exercise. This project combines my interest in both languages while diving deep into Zig's unique approach to compiler design.

## Inspiration
- Mitchell Hashimoto's excellent blog series on the Zig compiler: https://mitchellh.com/zig
- The official Zig Language repository: https://github.com/ziglang/zig
